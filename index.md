gh-pages test
===

This is a page written in GLFM as an exploration of pages functions. It has three aims:

1. To remind me of MD syntax specifically related to GLFM
2. To familiarise myself with different Pages themes and Jekyll
3. To act as a sandbox for things I want to test out in future.

That's all!

## Sandbox 1: Description Lists

## Sandbox 2: Task Lists

## Sandbox 3: Page Tables

## Sandbox 4: JSON

- No ðŸ‘Ž

### possible TBD: LaTeX, code blocks, ToCs and diagrams
